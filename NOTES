#Time Stamp Analysis:
-when files are created, modified, or accessed and when the filesystem structures that contain the metadata for those files are changed.
-UNIX and Linux : atime records the time the file was last accessed.
                : mtime records the most recent modification to the contents of the file
                : ctime records the most recent change to the file's metadata such as ownership, filename, file location, or file permissions
-WINDOWS: /NTFS/: $MFT store medta data
                : $STANDARD_INFORMATION :read only, hidden, archive, time stamps
                : $FILE_NAME :  full Unicode name of the file
                : $DATA more than one : stores the data itself
-alternate data streams (ADSs) used to hide additional data within the filesystem and are used by browsers to track files that were downloaded from the Internet
-NtfsDisableLastAccessUpdate >>> HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem registry key
-time stamps of files often only modify the time stamps in the $STANDARD_INFORMATION
-information about user activity, including files opened, applications launched, and more, may be found in the user's home directory in the AppData\Local\ConnectedDevicesPlatform\L.%USERNAME%\ActivitiesC ache.db database
-Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent  >> viewed in Windows Explorer, the name of the folder will appear as Recent Items
-Windows 10, the LNK files are created when a file is opened or a new file is created include the original extension
-Prefetch, which recorded the files needed by each application on the system and preloaded those files once the application was launched in
-security identifier (SID) responsible for launching the executable, the volume of data accessed on disk by the executable, CPU time in foreground and background,
  HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\SRUM\Extensions 
#Registry Analysis:
%SystemRoot%\System32\Config // SYSTEM, SAM, SECURITY, SOFTWARE, and DEFAULT hive files
user account also has associated registry hive files called NTUSER.DAT
MRU: HKEY_USERS\SID\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RecentDocs 
Registry Explorer used to view the Run key for unauthorized executables
executables that have
been run on the system in the 
  HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\bam\UserSettings
  HKEY_USERS\SID\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Search\RecentApps >>> 
#EVIDENCE OF EXECUTION >> Amcache ,UserAssist,ActivitiesCache,prefetch,AppCompatCache
$UsnJrnl $J file: e USN journal can provide information such as when files were created, renamed (including moved), or changed. For renames, both the old and the new names are recorded
Volume Shadow Copies VSS: backups of files, even protected system files stored in System Volume Information >> vssadmin 
#linux forinces:
- /etc/passwd
- /etc/group
- /etc/sudoers : modified to allow user accounts to increase their privileges through the sudo command
- Persistence : initialization scripts run to start processes
